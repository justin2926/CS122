## Insights
# Word Cloud
The most frequent hashtag used I noticed was "foodie" and that can be seen in the word cloud.

# Likes vs Shares
In the likes vs shares chart, I noticed that the more likes you have, the more shares you have and the correlation between the two is pretty strong.

# Monthly Posts
I noticed that during the ending and beginning of the year, there were significantly more posts. This was suprising especially because I would've expected the middle of the year (summer) to have a lot more posts as well.
